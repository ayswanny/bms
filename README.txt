This project was assigned by Dr. Baliga from Rowan University to gain a better 
understanding of operating systems, process scheduling, and memory allocation. 
The key concept here was implementing a buddy system to allocate and deallocate
memory.

To run the simulator, type 'make' to compile in temrinal and run with ./bms

	This program takes one parameter to specify the depth of the tree. Use 4-7 for 
	the best results.

NOTE: This code uses on both gtk2.0 and gtk3.0 libraries. Although version 2.0 of gtk
has been deprecated, the code still requires this. In order to run
this program, have both versions installed in your "user include" directory.

To run the test suite, type 'make test' to compile in terminal and run with ./test

	This program take no parameters, no asserts should fail. If they do, please contact
	me at swanso52@students.rowan.edu

Furthermore, any questions regarding the assignment or code may be e-mailed to the 
address posted above. 

Thank you,
